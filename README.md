## Overview

Itch.io page can be found [here](https://chyrro.itch.io/social-distancing).

The game is a classic life simulator where the player can go fishing or do some gardening. Even though it is very basic, we still implemented a shop system, in order to give more depth to the gameplay. It has been a very great way to experiment with scriptable objects and the new input system.
